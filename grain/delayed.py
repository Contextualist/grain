    Args:
      nout (int): If set, the return value of the function is assumed
        to be a iterable with length ``nout``, so that indexing and
        unpacking on the delayed object is allowed.
      copy_on_setitem (bool): The default (True) is a safe option to

    Do not construct this directly, this is intended to be the return
    value of a :class:`DelayedFn`.

    A ``Delayed`` supports most python operations, each of which creates
    another ``Delayed`` representing the result:

        * Most operators (``*``, ``-``, ``+=`` (treated as ``+``), ...)
        * Item iteration, indexing, and slicing (``a[0]``)
        * Item mutation __setitem__ (``a[0] = 1``)
        * Attribute access (``a.size``)
        * Method calls (``a.index(0)``)

    Operations that arenâ€™t supported include:

        * Attr mutation __setattr__ (``a.foo = 1``)
        * Use as a predicate (``if a: ...``)

    This is mostly a copy of the implementaton in Dask, but there are
    several main differences from Dask:

        1. Grain's Delayed assumes all ops are cheap and perform them
           locally.
        2. As all delayed objects are reduced locally, and Grain worker
           does not cache results, it is not allowed to pass delayed
           objects to a delayed function; we want to be explicit on
           the intention of dependent/serial jobs. e.g.::

               r1 = await dfn1()
               r2 = await dfn2(r1)

        3. Calling a delayed function submit the calculation immediately.
        4. A Delayed object is somehow mutable, ``setitem`` is allowed
           but ``setattr`` is not (implemented).
